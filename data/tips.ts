    title: 'Clear Hierarchy',
    description: 'Make your most important elements stand out. Use size, contrast, or position so a user knows instantly what they should look at first. Don\'t make them hunt for the main action or message.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-2',
    title: 'Mind the Edges',
    description: 'Give your content some room to breathe! Ample white space (or "negative space") around text and elements prevents that cramped, cluttered feeling. It\'s like having elbow room at a dinner table.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-3',
    title: 'Contrast is King',
    description: 'Ensure a strong difference between your text and background. This isn\'t just about looking nice; it\'s vital for readability and accessibility. Think high-visibility vest, not camouflage.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-4',
    title: 'Color Psychology',
    description: 'Pick colors that align with your message and brand emotion. Green often feels fresh or trustworthy, blue can be corporate and calming. Don\'t just pick colors you like, pick colors that work.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-5',
    title: 'Font Family Harmony',
    description: 'Limit yourself to just one or two complementary font families. Too many typefaces on one page is distracting and messy. It\'s better to be consistent than a typographic circus.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-6',
    title: 'Align Everything',
    description: 'Be a stickler for neatness! Ensure all elements on a horizontal or vertical axis are perfectly lined up. Misalignment looks sloppy and screams "amateur hour."'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-7',
    title: 'Simplify Shapes',
    description: 'Use basic, recognizable shapes for buttons and icons. People process simple geometric forms much faster. Complexity often leads to confusion and slow adoption.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-8',
    title: 'Texture & Depth',
    description: 'Use subtle shadows or gradients sparingly to give elements a physical, liftable feel. This adds depth and makes interactive elements look more "pressable" or tangible.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-9',
    title: 'Iconography Clarity',
    description: 'Your icons should be universally understood, like a home or a shopping cart. Avoid overly abstract or unique symbols that require a legend to explain them. Don\'t make your users guess.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-10',
    title: 'Consistent Scale',
    description: 'Maintain a proportional size relationship between all elements. If all your images are different sizes, it feels haphazard. Establishing a visual rhythm makes the design feel intentional.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-11',
    title: 'One Primary Action',
    description: 'On any given screen, funnel your user toward one main goal. Make that button or link the most prominent thing they see. Too many choices create decision paralysis.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-12',
    title: 'F-Pattern Scan',
    description: 'People naturally scan screens in an \'F\' or \'Z\' shape. Place your most critical content—like headlines and navigation—along those high-traffic paths. Don\'t bury the lead!'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-13',
    title: 'Feedback is Essential',
    description: 'When a user clicks a button, let them know it worked! Change the button\'s color, show a loader, or display a success message. No feedback feels like talking to a brick wall.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-14',
    title: 'Keep Navigation Predictable',
    description: 'Put your navigation in expected spots, like the top header or left sidebar. Users are creatures of habit and expect familiarity. Innovation shouldn\'t compromise utility.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-15',
    title: 'Form Field Labels',
    description: 'Don\'t hide your form labels inside the fields (placeholder text). Labels should always be visible above or beside the input box so users don\'t forget the context when typing.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-16',
    title: 'Load Time Matters',
    description: 'Users are impatient, and every second counts. Optimize your images and code so the page loads fast. A slow experience is a broken experience.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-17',
    title: 'Mobile First Mentality',
    description: 'Design for the smallest screen before the biggest one. If it works beautifully and clearly on a phone, it will scale up nicely. Prioritize simplicity and touch-friendly targets.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-18',
    title: 'Error Prevention',
    description: 'The best error message is the one a user never sees. Design forms that anticipate mistakes, like checking password strength in real-time. Guide them gently away from failure.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-19',
    title: 'Don\'t Hide Help',
    description: 'Make your help or support resources easily discoverable, perhaps through a subtle, persistent icon or clear footer link. When users get stuck, they should find an exit fast.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-20',
    title: 'Chunk Information',
    description: 'Break large blocks of text into smaller, digestible paragraphs and lists. Our brains prefer bite-sized pieces over a massive wall of text. Scannability is key online.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-21',
    title: 'Headline Power',
    description: 'Your headline is your first and often last chance to grab attention. Make it clear, benefit-driven, and engaging—no jargon allowed. Be punchy and direct.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-22',
    title: 'Plain Language Works',
    description: 'Write your copy for a broad audience, using simple, common words. Avoid overly technical terms or buzzwords that confuse or alienate. Clarity beats cleverness.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-23',
    title: 'Establish Trust',
    description: 'Use testimonials, security badges, or clear privacy policies where appropriate. Users need to feel safe and confident when engaging with your site or product.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-24',
    title: 'Show, Don\'t Tell',
    description: 'Whenever possible, replace long descriptive text with a relevant image or short video. Visuals are processed much faster than reading a paragraph. Graphics bridge the gap.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-25',
    title: 'Use Active Voice',
    description: 'Write your calls to action and instructions with strong, direct verbs like "Get Started" or "Download Now." Active voice is more engaging and clear than passive language.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-26',
    title: 'Group Related Items',
    description: 'Use the Gestalt Principle of Proximity—put things that belong together close together. This makes the interface feel organized and makes cognitive sense.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-27',
    title: 'Single Page Scrolls',
    description: 'For simple, linear content, a long, continuous scroll is often better than multiple clicks. Users are used to scrolling (thanks, social media!).'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-28',
    title: 'Focus State Clarity',
    description: 'Ensure that when a user tabs through your interface, the currently selected element (the focus state) is clearly visible. This is vital for keyboard navigation and accessibility.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-29',
    title: 'Ditch the Carousel',
    description: 'Those rotating image sliders often have poor click-through rates. Users miss important information. It\'s often better to show your most important content statically.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-30',
    title: 'Leverage Defaults',
    description: 'Pre-select the most common or safest option in forms or settings. Users appreciate not having to make an unnecessary decision. Minimize cognitive load.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-31',
    title: 'Maintain Visual Consistency',
    description: 'Every button, card, and text style should look the same across your entire experience. This builds familiarity and makes the interface feel reliable.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-32',
    title: 'Avoid Jargon',
    description: 'Explain complex ideas using common, everyday analogies. If you have to use a technical term, offer a simple tooltip definition.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-33',
    title: 'Show Progress Steps',
    description: 'For multi-step processes (like checkout or onboarding), clearly indicate which step they are on and how many are left. This reduces frustration and improves completion rates.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-34',
    title: 'Use Real Content',
    description: 'Design with actual text and images, not "lorem ipsum" placeholders. Dummy content can hide design flaws and make your layouts look artificially clean.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-35',
    title: 'Test with Users',
    description: 'The most important tip: your users are not you. Test your designs with real people to uncover blind spots. Design is for others.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-36',
    title: 'Repetition Builds Comfort',
    description: 'Be consistent with the placement of recurring elements like search bars, login links, or primary CTAs. When things are where users expect them, their experience is much smoother. Predictability equals ease.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-37',
    title: 'Breadcrumbs for Orientation',
    description: 'For deep websites, use clear navigational "breadcrumbs" (e.g., Home > Products > Shoes). This helps users know exactly where they are and easily jump back up a level without getting lost.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-38',
    title: 'The 8-Pixel Rule',
    description: 'Use multiples of eight (8, 16, 24, 32, etc.) for all your spacing and sizing measurements. This creates a uniform grid and makes your entire layout feel harmonious and mathematically clean.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-39',
    title: 'Z-Pattern Scans',
    description: 'For simple, marketing-heavy pages, guide the eye in a \'Z\' shape (across the top, down the diagonal, across the bottom). Place critical elements along this natural reading path.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-40',
    title: 'Visual Weight Balance',
    description: 'Don\'t stack all the heavy, dark, or large elements on one side of the screen. Distribute the visual energy evenly so the page feels stable and not like it\'s tilting over.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-41',
    title: 'Negative Space Framing',
    description: 'Use empty space to intentionally isolate and frame important content. Think of it like a beautiful photo matting—the space around the subject makes the subject more impactful.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-42',
    title: 'Prioritize Content Length',
    description: 'Design your boxes and containers based on the expected length of the content. Don\'t force a long product name into a tiny box; design for the real-world usage.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-43',
    title: 'Establish Flow Direction',
    description: 'Use arrows, lines, or visual hierarchy to clearly indicate the path a user should take through the page. A well-designed page should naturally guide the eye from A to B.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-44',
    title: 'Cards for Collections',
    description: 'When presenting many similar items (like products or articles), use clean, defined card layouts. Cards make the content feel modular, scannable, and easy to process individually.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-45',
    title: 'Don\'t Over-Layer',
    description: 'Avoid stacking too many elements directly on top of each other. Each layer adds cognitive work. Keep things simple and flat unless the interaction absolutely requires depth.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-46',
    title: 'Optimal Line Length',
    description: 'Aim for about 50 to 75 characters per line of body text. Lines that are too short break reading rhythm; lines that are too long make it hard to find the start of the next one.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-47',
    title: 'Use Bold Sparingly',
    description: 'Bold text is excellent for emphasizing key phrases or words within a paragraph. However, if you bold entire sentences or too many words, it loses its meaning and looks aggressive.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-48',
    title: 'No Full Justification',
    description: 'Avoid using "justified" alignment for body text (where both left and right edges are straight). This creates awkward rivers of white space and makes reading uncomfortable online.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-49',
    title: 'Line Height Comfort',
    description: 'Set your line spacing (leading) a bit more generously for web copy, usually 1.5 times the text size. This airy spacing helps prevent lines from bleeding together, improving readability.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-50',
    title: 'Choose Legible Fonts',
    description: 'Prioritize fonts that are clear and easy to read at small sizes. Beautiful but overly decorative or thin fonts should be reserved only for large headlines, if at all.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-51',
    title: 'Text Size Hierarchy',
    description: 'Establish a clear size difference between your H1, H2, body copy, and captions. The sizing structure must visually reflect the importance of the text.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-52',
    title: 'Capitals Are Shouting',
    description: 'Use ALL CAPS only for short, specific elements like abbreviations or labels. Writing whole paragraphs in capitals is tiring for the reader and feels aggressive.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-53',
    title: 'Ditch the Cursives',
    description: 'Avoid using script or handwriting-style fonts for large blocks of text. While they can add personality, they significantly reduce reading speed and accessibility.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-54',
    title: 'Kerning and Spacing',
    description: 'Pay attention to the space between individual letters (kerning). Especially in large headlines, ensure the letters don\'t look awkwardly squished or too far apart.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-55',
    title: 'Microcopy Matters',
    description: 'Use friendly, helpful, and concise text for small instructional elements like password requirements, error messages, and button labels. This tiny text guides the user.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-56',
    title: 'Test Color Blindness',
    description: 'Check your color palette using online simulators to ensure it remains understandable for those with color vision deficiency. Don\'t rely solely on color to convey important information.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-57',
    title: 'Alt Text for Images',
    description: 'Always add descriptive "alt text" to your images. This is crucial for screen readers and also helps if an image fails to load. Images need words, too.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-58',
    title: 'Use Real Photos',
    description: 'Whenever possible, use authentic, high-quality photos over generic, stale stock imagery. Real photos build a genuine connection and look much more trustworthy.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-59',
    title: 'Avoid Flicker',
    description: 'Steer clear of fast-moving animations or elements that flash rapidly. This can be disturbing or even hazardous for some users (photosensitivity). Prioritize calm motion.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-60',
    title: 'Hover States are Key',
    description: 'When a mouse cursor hovers over an interactive element, make sure it changes slightly. This subtle visual cue signals to the user, "Yes, you can click me."'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-61',
    title: 'Keyboard Navigation',
    description: 'Ensure every part of your site is fully usable using only a keyboard (tab, arrow keys, enter). This is a foundational step for accessibility compliance.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-62',
    title: 'Touch Target Size',
    description: 'Make sure buttons and links are large enough to be easily tapped on a phone screen, typically at least 48x48 pixels. Tiny targets lead to frustrating misclicks.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-63',
    title: 'Don\'t Mute Links',
    description: 'Ensure hyperlinked text has sufficient contrast and is clearly distinguishable from regular body text—often via an underline or a distinct color.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-64',
    title: 'Subtle Motion Guide',
    description: 'Use tiny, elegant animations to gently draw the user\'s attention to a new item or a completed action. Motion should inform, not distract.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-65',
    title: 'Dark Mode Option',
    description: 'Offer a dark theme if your application is used for long periods. Reducing bright light can decrease eye strain and save battery life on many devices.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-66',
    title: 'Design in Iterations',
    description: 'Don\'t try to build the final, perfect design right away. Create a quick, messy version first, then refine, test, and polish over several focused steps. Perfection is slow.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-67',
    title: 'Document Your System',
    description: 'Create a single source of truth for your colors, fonts, and component rules. This keeps the design consistent, speeds up future work, and helps new team members.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-68',
    title: 'Prototype Early',
    description: 'Turn your designs into clickable mockups fast. Seeing how a design feels when you interact with it is totally different from seeing static images.'

  {
    id: 'tip-69',
    title: 'Define User Scenarios',
    description: 'Before designing a page, write down a few simple stories about why a user would be on that page and what they hope to accomplish. This keeps the design goal-oriented.'

  {
    id: 'tip-70',
    title: 'Less is Truly More',
    description: 'Remove any element—text, image, button—that doesn\'t directly contribute to the user\'s goal or the site\'s purpose. Subtract complexity.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-71',
    title: 'Design for Scalability',
    description: 'Build your components (like cards or buttons) in a way that allows them to accommodate much longer or shorter content in the future without breaking the layout.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-72',
    title: 'Collect Design Inspiration',

    id: 'tip-74',
    title: 'Stay Open to Changes',

    title: 'Measure Performance',
    description: 'Track key metrics—like conversion rates, time on task, and bounce rates—to know if your design changes are actually improving the user experience.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-76',
    title: 'Loading State Feedback',
    description: 'When content is loading, use a simple, smooth skeleton screen or a progress bar. Showing that something is happening eases anxiety and perception of wait time.'

  },
  {
    id: 'tip-79',
    title: 'Tooltips for Power Users',
    description: 'Use subtle, contextual tooltips to explain complex features or options that only experienced users might need. Keep the core interface simple for everyone else.'
  },
  {
    id: 'tip-80',
    title: 'Use Easing Gently',
    description: 'When using animations, use smooth "easing" functions (like ease-in-out) rather than linear movement. This makes the motion look natural, physical, and polished.'
